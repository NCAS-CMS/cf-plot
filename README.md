# cf-plot

## Code-light plotting for earth science and aligned research

cf-plot allows you to produce and customise publication-quality contour, vector, line and more plots
with the power of Python, matplotlib and Cartopy, in as few lines of code as possible.

It is designed to be a useful tool across the various domains in and around environmental and
earth science, including climate and meteorological research.
